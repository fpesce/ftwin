/**
 * @brief Calculates the XXH128 checksum of a file.

 *
 * @param[in] filename The path to the file.
 * @param[in] size The size of the file.
 * @param[in] excess_size The file size threshold above which buffered reading is used instead of mmap.
 * @param[out] hash_out Pointer to a ft_hash_t structure to store the resulting checksum.
 * @param[in] gc_pool An APR pool for temporary allocations during the operation.
 * @return APR_SUCCESS on success, or an APR error code on failure.

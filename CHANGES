0.3.0:
    - bugfix: - if a file did not have correct permissions (read bit for
		user/group/world) to be read/checksumed, it should have crashed
		ftwin, now it silently (unless verbose mode) skip the file
		instead. Same patch for dir and execute bit.
    - feature: - add the -p implementation, files in a path preppended
		 by its (-p) param will be displayed first (example :
		 -p /home/joke/ will display /home/joke/dup before /etc/dup),
		 this may be useful to script a deletion for example.
    - bugfix: - big file may overuse memory when using mmap syscall where it is
		implemented, so for files whose size > excess (defined by
		parameter -x, default 50Mo), use a standard chunk read method.

0.2.0:
    - legal: - copyrights added.
    - feature: - output reordered by size, add an option to display them.

0.1.0:
    - import: Initial version of ftwin, with basic command line options.

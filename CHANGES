0.5.1:
    - bugfix: - permissions are now processed correctly when ftwin collect
                files and path informations.

    - cosmetic: - Add example file, and manpage.

0.5.0:
    - feature: - Add a -I option that switch ftwin into duplicate image
		 finding, in this mode, ftwin search for image that are copy of
		 each other, even if they are resized, using libpuzzle.

0.4.0:
    - feature: - Add a whitelisting option, you may want to select files whose
		 name match a particular regexp for comparison.
		 For example the following line will report duplicate files
		 whose extension is .txt and that are not in a .svn directory:
		 ./ftwin -e ".*/\.svn/.*" -w ".*\.txt$" -v -r ${HOME}

    - bugfix: - mmap checksum mmap is done by block of the same size than
                cheksum by read.
		The value of checksums were different, now it is the same if
		two files are on different type of fs (one mmap-capable, the
		other not).

    - bugfix-minor: - Fix a minor memleak by attaching pcre * to an apr_pool.

0.3.1:
    - bugfix: - if a file disappear between the collecting phase and the
                comparing phase, it will just display skipping message.
                That may happen when cleaning a cache during ftwin session.

    - bugfix: - if a file is on a device (typically /sys/ or /proc/) that does
                not allow mmaping, switch to a more standard read mode.

    - bugfix: - Add support for apr-1-config and apu-1-config on mandriva arch
                in acinclude.m4. (reported by Lou Afonso)

0.3.0:
    - bugfix: - if a file did not have correct permissions (read bit for
                user/group/world) to be read/checksumed, it should have crashed
                ftwin, now it silently (unless verbose mode) skip the file
                instead. Same patch for dir and execute bit.
    - feature: - add the -p implementation, files in a path preppended
                 by its (-p) param will be displayed first (example :
                 -p /home/joke/ will display /home/joke/dup before /etc/dup),
                 this may be useful to script a deletion for example.
    - bugfix: - big file may overuse memory when using mmap syscall where it is
                implemented, so for files whose size > excess (defined by
                parameter -x, default 50Mo), use a standard chunk read method.

0.2.0:
    - legal: - copyrights added.
    - feature: - output reordered by size, add an option to display them.

0.1.0:
    - import: Initial version of ftwin, with basic command line options.
